# Codebase

## Best Practices
 - Do not use relative imports (TODO: Figure this out)

## Directories

`base/` contains classes/files used to run the server and help handle requests

`controllers/` contains the mappings from endpoints to methods for handling requests

`dataservices/` contain the classes/methods that connect to external services or datastores

`helpers/` contain small classes that are used frequently for interacting with other systems/tools
