# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

_Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates._

| Version | Supported          |

| < 0.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please [submit an issue](../../issues) that details the security concern (and ideally steps to take to fix or mitigate risk). If an issue is not responded to within 1 month, please
assume that this repo is stale and will not be updated.

If a suggested fix is accepted and applied, your name will be added to the contributors list in the README. If the suggested fix is declined, we will attempt to provide an explanation on the
Github issue created before closing the issue. You may or may not get notified of this via email depending on your notification preferences.
